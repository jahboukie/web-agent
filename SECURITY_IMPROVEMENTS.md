- Secure random generation
- Key derivation with timing consistency

**Improvements Made:**
- Updated `app/core/security.py` to use constant-time operations
- Added timing-safe arithmetic operations
- Implemented minimum execution time guarantees

### 5. Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers
**File:** `app/security/security_headers.py`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive security headers middleware
- Environment-specific CSP policies (strict production, permissive development)
- Cryptographic nonce generation for inline scripts/styles
- CSP violation reporting and analysis
- Complete security header suite (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Automatic suspicious violation detection
- Real-time CSP policy adjustment

**Security Headers Implemented:**
- Content-Security-Policy with nonce support
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- Cross-Origin policies (COEP, COOP, CORP)
- Expect-CT for Certificate Transparency

### 6. Cryptographic Operations Rate Limiting
**File:** `app/security/crypto_rate_limiter.py`

**Features:**
- Multi-layer rate limiting (global, per-user, per-operation, per-IP)
- Cost-based limiting (expensive operations cost more)
- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Burst allowance configuration
- Operation-specific limits and costs
- Real-time statistics and monitoring
- Decorator-based integration for easy adoption

**Rate Limiting Strategies:**
- Per-minute, per-hour, and per-day limits
- Cost-weighted operations (key derivation costs 10x more than hashing)
- User-specific quotas
- Global system protection
- Automatic retry-after headers

### 7. Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
**File:** `app/security/dependency_scanner.py`

**Features:**
- Multi-source vulnerability scanning (PyUp.io, Safety, OSV.dev)
- Concurrent scanning for performance
- Vulnerability deduplication and correlation
- Severity assessment and CVSS scoring
- Comprehensive security reporting
- Scan history and trend analysis
- Automated risk assessment

**Scanning Capabilities:**
- Real-time vulnerability detection
- Package risk scoring
- Remediation recommendations
- Security report generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Scheduled scanning support

## Integration Points

### FastAPI Middleware Integration
```python
from app.security.security_headers import SecurityHeadersMiddleware
from app.security.crypto_rate_limiter import initialize_crypto_rate_limiter

# Add to main.py
app.add_middleware(SecurityHeadersMiddleware)

# Initialize services
await initialize_crypto_rate_limiter()
```

### Decorator Usage
```python
from app.security.crypto_rate_limiter import rate_limit_key_derivation
from app.security.input_sanitization import SecureTextInput

@rate_limit_key_derivation
async def derive_user_key(password: str, user_id: int):
    # Automatically rate limited
    pass

# Input validation
secure_input = SecureTextInput(text=user_input, max_length=1000)
```

## Security Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- Input sanitization success rate
- Token blacklist hit rate
- Session security events
- Cryptographic operation timing
- CSP violation frequency
- Dependency vulnerability count

### Alerting Thresholds
- Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate alert
- High-severity vulnerabilities: 1-hour alert
