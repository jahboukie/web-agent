## 1. Executive Summary & Product Vision

### Core Mission
Build WebAgent: A single, integrated AI system that takes natural language goals and executes them reliably on any website through semantic understanding, intelligent planning, and robust browser automation.

### Success Metrics
- **Technical:** 85% success rate on 50 predefined web tasks within 6 months
- **Business:** 100 paying customers within 4 months of MVP launch
- **Product:** Sub-30 second average task completion time

### Non-Negotiable Principles
1. **Reliability Over Features:** A system that works 85% of the time on 10 tasks beats one that works 30% of the time on 100 tasks
2. **Human-in-the-Loop by Design:** Critical actions require user confirmation
3. **Security First:** User credentials and actions must be cryptographically secure
4. **Observable Operations:** Every action must be loggable and debuggable

## 4. Core System Components Specification

### 4.1 WebParser (Reader Phase)

**Primary Function:** Convert any webpage into structured, semantic data that AI can reason about.

**Claude Code Architecture Prompt:**
```
Claude, design the core architecture for WebParser service. Requirements:
1. Input: URL string
2. Output: Structured JSON with semantic elements (buttons, forms, links, text content)
3. Must handle SPAs with dynamic loading
4. Integration with both Playwright (DOM) and GPT-4V (screenshot analysis)
5. Caching layer for repeated URL parsing
6. Rate limiting and anti-detection measures

Design the Pydantic models for:
- WebPage (top-level container)
- InteractiveElement (buttons, links, forms)
- ContentBlock (text, images, media)
- ActionCapability (predicted user actions)

Include error handling patterns and retry logic.
```

**Augment Code Implementation Tasks:**
```
Augment, implement the WebParser service using the architecture Claude designed:

- Browser state validation between actions
- Error classification (temporary vs permanent failures)
- User intervention points for ambiguous situations

Include comprehensive logging and observability hooks.
```
