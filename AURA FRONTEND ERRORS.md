RECOMMENDED FIXES

Okay, this is a very comprehensive list of TypeScript errors, which means your frontend build is failing due to type strictness and potentially some structural issues. Let's break them down and prioritize.
The good news is that many of these are repetitive or fall into a few common categories.
Frontend Errors Analysis and Prioritization
I'll categorize the errors and suggest a tackling order:
Category 1: Critical Import / Module Resolution Issues (Highest Priority)
These errors mean your TypeScript compiler can't even find certain files or their type definitions. They are fundamental blockers.
Error: src/components/Dashboard.tsx(34,54): error TS2307: Cannot find module '../lib/utils' or its corresponding type declarations.
(This TS2307 error appears repeatedly for ../lib/utils across many files)
Problem: Your frontend code frequently imports from ../lib/utils, but TypeScript cannot find this module. This could mean:
* The file src/lib/utils.ts (or .tsx, .js, etc.) does not exist.
* The path is incorrect.
* The file exists, but it's not exporting what it needs to, or your tsconfig.json isn't configured to find it.
Fix:
Verify the file path: Check your project structure. Do you have a src/lib/utils.ts (or .js, .tsx) file?
Check for typos: Ensure the import path ../lib/utils is exactly correct relative to the file importing it.
Ensure exports: If the file exists, make sure it's exporting the formatNumber function (and cn if that's also in utils) correctly:
Generated typescript
// src/lib/utils.ts
export function formatNumber(num: number): string { /* ... */ }
export function cn(...args: any[]): string { /* ... */ } // if using clsx or similar
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
tsconfig.json check (less likely to be the primary issue for simple relative paths): Ensure your tsconfig.json has include or baseUrl set up correctly if you're using absolute paths or path aliases. For relative imports like this, it's usually about the file's existence or basic export.
This is the MOST important one to fix first, as it's causing a cascade of "cannot find" errors and preventing proper type checking for related code.
Category 2: TypeScript Compiler Option Specific Syntax (High Priority)
These errors indicate that you're using syntax that is disallowed or required to be different due to specific strict compiler options.
Error: src/types/index.ts(23,13): error TS1294: This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled. (many occurrences in src/types/index.ts)
Error: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx(13,3): error TS1484: 'ReactNode' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled.
Problem (TS1294 with erasableSyntaxOnly): This is very specific. When erasableSyntaxOnly is enabled in tsconfig.json, TypeScript might be trying to ensure that all type-related syntax can be completely removed during compilation to JavaScript without affecting runtime behavior. The common issue is mixing type declarations directly with export or import of values.
Problem (TS1484 with verbatimModuleSyntax): Similar to above, verbatimModuleSyntax is a very strict mode. It demands that you differentiate between importing values and importing types explicitly.
Fix (for TS1294 & TS1484):
Option A (Recommended for strictness): Adjust your code to be explicit.
For TS1484: Change import { ReactNode } from 'react'; to import type { ReactNode } from 'react';. Do this for any other type imports (e.g., import type { FC } from 'react';).
For TS1294: In src/types/index.ts (and potentially other type definition files), ensure you're explicitly using export type or import type where appropriate, rather than just export interface or export class if it only contains types. For example:
Generated typescript
// If it's a type alias or interface:
export type MyType = { /* ... */ };
export interface MyInterface { /* ... */ }
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
If you have export { MyType }; where MyType is only a type, you might need export type { MyType };.
Option B (Less recommended, but quicker): Relax tsconfig.json (temporarily).
Locate your tsconfig.json file.
Find compilerOptions.
Set verbatimModuleSyntax to false (or remove it if it's there).
Set erasableSyntaxOnly to false (or remove it).
However, be cautious: These options are there for a reason (e.g., for bundling tools like Rollup or ESBuild, or for ensuring clear type vs. value imports). It's generally better to fix the code to comply.
I recommend trying Option A first, especially for import type. If TS1294 persists and you're unsure, then consider relaxing erasableSyntaxOnly just to get the build passing, but aim to understand and fix it properly later.
Category 3: Null/Undefined Checks & Type Mismatches (High Priority)
These errors indicate potential runtime bugs where values might be null or undefined when you try to use them, or where you're passing/assigning values that don't match the expected type.
Error: src/components/Dashboard.tsx(144,8): error TS18048: 'stats.upgrade_opportunities.length' is possibly 'undefined'.
Error: src/components/Dashboard.tsx(150,18): error TS18047: 'stats' is possibly 'null'. (many occurrences)
Error: src/components/Dashboard.tsx(193,13): error TS2322: Type '{...}' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & StatCardProps'. Property 'benchmark' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & StatCardProps'.
Error: src/components/EnhancedDashboard.tsx(56,26): error TS2339: Property 'subscription_tier' does not exist on type 'User'.
Error: src/services/demoService.ts(235,21): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ id: number; email: any; password: any; full_name: any; security_role: string; trust_score: number; mfa_enabled: boolean; tenant_id: any; is_active: boolean; is_verified: boolean; last_login: null; created_at: string; updated_at: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ ... }'. Types of property 'last_login' are incompatible. Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string'.
Error: src/components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx(253,16): error TS2345: Argument of type 'DashboardStats' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SetStateAction<DashboardStats | null>'. Type 'DashboardStats' is missing the following properties from type 'DashboardStats': roi_calculation, billing_info
Fixes:
For TS18047 (possibly 'null') and TS18048 (possibly 'undefined'):
Implement checks: if (stats !== null && stats.upgrade_opportunities !== undefined) { ... } or use optional chaining stats?.upgrade_opportunities?.length.
Ensure data fetching properly handles loading states or initial null/undefined values, and that your components account for them.
Update your state types if stats or upgrade_opportunities can indeed be null or undefined (e.g., useState<DashboardStats | null>(null)).
For TS2322 (Type not assignable, property does not exist):
This means your StatCardProps type definition (likely in src/components/Dashboard.tsx or a related types file) does not include a benchmark property.
Fix: Add benchmark?: string; (or benchmark: string; if it's always required) to your StatCardProps interface/type.
Check src/types/index.ts or src/types/dashboard.ts (if you have one) for StatCardProps.
For TS2339 (Property 'subscription_tier' does not exist on type 'User'):
Your User type definition (likely in src/types/index.ts or src/types/auth.ts) does not include subscription_tier.
Fix: Add subscription_tier?: string; (or similar, depending on its type) to your User interface/type.
For TS2345 (Argument type incompatible / property types incompatible):
This means the User object you are constructing or receiving has last_login: null, but the type it's being assigned to expects last_login: string.
Fix: Update the type definition for last_login to last_login: string | null; in your User type or the type of the parameter that expects this object.
The DashboardStats error suggests your DashboardStats type is missing roi_calculation and billing_info. Add these properties to its definition.
Category 4: Implicit Any and Untyped Calls (Medium Priority)
These errors occur when TypeScript can't infer a type and your tsconfig.json has noImplicitAny: true.
Error: src/services/apiService.ts(91,8): error TS7006: Parameter 'config' implicitly has an 'any' type. (many similar errors for config, error, response)
Error: src/services/apiService.ts(210,30): error TS2347: Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments.
Fixes:
For TS7006 (implicitly has an 'any' type):
Add explicit type annotations to function parameters.
Example: function handleRequest(config: AxiosRequestConfig): ... or (error: unknown): ....
For error, consider error: any if you're not using TypeScript 4.4+ or haven't configured useUnknownInCatchVariables (or error: unknown and then type narrowing if you're on a newer TS).
For TS2347 (Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments):
This often happens with generic functions (like axios.get<MyType>('/api/data')) if the function itself is not typed (e.g., from an untyped library or because it's implicitly any).
Fix: Ensure the underlying function is properly typed or that you've imported type definitions for it. If it's your own function, add explicit types.
Category 5: Unused Variables/Imports (Low Priority, but good for cleanup)
These are mostly linting-style errors indicating dead code.
Error: src/App.tsx(9,8): error TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read. (many similar TS6133 errors for useEffect, error, Shield, Users, formatNumber, etc.)
Error: src/components/Dashboard.tsx(38,3): error TS6196: 'UpgradeOpportunity' is declared but never used.
Fix:
Remove unused imports: If React or useEffect are imported but not directly used in JSX or hooks (common in newer React versions that automatically import them), you can often remove the import line. Or if you need them, ensure they are actively used.
Remove unused variables/functions: If a variable or function is declared but never referenced, delete it.
Use the variable: Sometimes, these are just warnings that you might intend to use later. If so, integrate them into your code.
Recommended Action Plan
Start with TS2307: Cannot find module '../lib/utils'. This will likely clear up many other downstream errors.
Tackle TS1294 and TS1484 in src/types/index.ts and src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx. Get your type definitions and imports correct according to your tsconfig.json's strict settings.
Address TS1804x (null/undefined checks) and TS23xx (type assignment/property doesn't exist) errors. These are crucial for the correctness and robustness of your application's logic. This might involve adding if (x !== null) checks or updating your interface/type definitions.
Work on TS7006 (implicit any) errors. Add explicit types to parameters.
Finally, clean up TS6133 and TS6196 (unused variables/imports).
This is a significant amount of work, but going through it methodically, starting with the foundational issues, will make it manageable. Good luck!
