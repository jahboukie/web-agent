# WebAgent CI/CD Dependency Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your CI/CD pipeline is failing due to a **dependency version conflict** in Poetry:

### **Root Cause:**
```
tiktoken = "^0.5.2"  # Your pyproject.toml (allows 0.5.x)
vs
tiktoken (>=0.7,<1)  # Required by langchain-openai (needs 0.7.x+)
```

This creates an impossible dependency resolution that Poetry cannot solve.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

I've updated your `pyproject.toml` with the correct versions:

### **Before:**
```toml
tiktoken = "^0.5.2"
langchain-community = "^0.0.20"
```

### **After:**
```toml
tiktoken = "^0.7.0"
langchain-community = "^0.2.0"
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Fix CI/CD**

### **Step 1: Update Poetry Lock File**
```bash
poetry lock --no-update
```

### **Step 2: Test Dependency Resolution**
```bash
poetry install --dry-run
```

### **Step 3: Commit the Changes**
```bash
git add pyproject.toml poetry.lock
git commit -m "fix: resolve tiktoken version conflict for CI/CD"
git push
```

### **Step 4: Verify CI/CD Pipeline**
Your GitHub Actions should now pass the dependency installation step.

## 🔧 **Alternative Quick Fix (If Still Issues)**

If you're still having issues, you can temporarily pin specific versions:

```toml
# In pyproject.toml, replace the LangChain section with:
langchain = "0.1.20"
langchain-openai = "0.1.8"
langchain-community = "0.2.1"
langchain-core = "0.1.52"
tiktoken = "0.7.0"
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After applying this fix:

1. ✅ **Poetry install** will complete successfully
2. ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** will pass the dependency installation step
3. ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** can run without dependency errors
4. ✅ **Tests** can import LangChain modules correctly

## 🎉 **Why This Fixes the Issue**

The error was caused by Poetry's dependency resolver finding conflicting requirements:

- **LangChain packages** (langchain-openai, langchain-core, etc.) all require `tiktoken >= 0.7`
- **Your pyproject.toml** specified `tiktoken ^0.5.2` (which means 0.5.x only)
- **Poetry couldn't find a version** that satisfied both constraints

By updating to `tiktoken = "^0.7.0"`, we align with LangChain's requirements.

## 🔍 **Validation Script**

I've created `test_dependencies.py` to help you validate the fix:

```bash
python test_dependencies.py
```

This will test:
- Poetry dependency resolution
- Lock file consistency
- Installation dry-run

## 📝 **Summary**

**Issue:** Tiktoken version conflict (0.5.x vs 0.7.x requirement)
**Fix:** Updated pyproject.toml to use tiktoken ^0.7.0
**Result:** CI/CD pipeline should now pass dependency installation

This is a common issue when LangChain packages update their requirements. The fix ensures compatibility with the latest LangChain ecosystem while maintaining your WebAgent functionality.

## 🚪 **Ready for Deployment**

Once you run `poetry lock` and commit the changes, your CI/CD pipeline should pass and your WebAgent platform will be ready for deployment with the latest compatible dependencies.
