# WebAgent Zero Trust & SIEM Implementation

## üéØ Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive Zero Trust Security Framework and enhanced SIEM Integration for WebAgent, completing the enterprise security architecture with production-ready capabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Zero Trust Security Framework

### **Core Implementation**
**File:** `app/security/zero_trust.py` (1,118 lines)

### **Key Features**
- **Continuous Verification** - Never trust, always verify principle
- **Multi-Factor Trust Calculation** - Authentication, device, location, behavioral, network, session factors
- **ML-Powered Behavioral Analysis** - Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- **Device Fingerprinting** - Comprehensive device identification and trust assessment
- **Risk Factor Identification** - 8 behavioral risk factors with automated detection
- **Adaptive Policies** - 4 trust levels with dynamic access restrictions

### **Trust Calculation Engine**
```python
async def calculate_trust_score(
    user_id: int,
    access_context: AccessContext,
    device_fingerprint: Optional[DeviceFingerprint] = None
) -> TrustAssessment:
    """
    Multi-factor trust calculation:
    - Authentication trust (25% weight)
    - Device trust (20% weight)
    - Location trust (15% weight)
    - Behavioral trust (20% weight)
    - Network trust (15% weight)
    - Session factors (5% weight)
    """
```

### **Zero Trust Policies**
- **Critical Systems**: 99% trust required, MFA + managed device
- **Sensitive Data**: 80% trust required, MFA + registered device
- **Standard Access**: 60% trust required, basic verification
- **Public Access**: 30% trust required, minimal restrictions

- Unknown/untrusted devices
- Rapid request patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
