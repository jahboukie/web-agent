- **Public Access** (30% trust required) - Minimal restrictions applied

**Trust Calculation Engine:**
- Authentication Trust (25% weight) - MFA, SSO, password age
- Device Trust (20% weight) - Managed devices, encryption, compliance
- Location Trust (15% weight) - Known locations, travel velocity analysis
- Behavioral Trust (20% weight) - ML-powered anomaly detection
- Network Trust (15% weight) - IP reputation, threat intelligence
- Session Factors (5% weight) - Session age, concurrent sessions
