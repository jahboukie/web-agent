## Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: Database Architecture (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** PostgreSQL as primary database with Redis for caching
**Rationale:** 
- Complex relational data requires ACID compliance
- Need for JSON fields for flexible metadata storage
- Redis provides high-performance caching for browser sessions
- PostgreSQL's async support aligns with FastAPI

**Alternatives Considered:**
- MongoDB: Rejected due to complex relationships between entities
- SQLite: Rejected due to scalability requirements

**Impact:** Enables complex queries and maintains data consistency

### AD-002: AI Model Integration Strategy (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** Multi-model approach with OpenAI and Anthropic
**Rationale:**
- GPT-4V for visual webpage analysis
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning and planning
- Fallback options provide reliability
- Different models excel at different tasks

**Implementation:**
- Abstract model interface for easy switching
- Configuration-driven model selection
- Cost and performance monitoring

### AD-003: Browser Automation Architecture (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** Playwright with Browserbase cloud integration
**Rationale:**
- Playwright's async support aligns with FastAPI
- Cloud browsers provide scalability
- Anti-detection capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Selenium: Rejected due to synchronous nature
- Pure cloud solution: Rejected due to cost and control concerns

### AD-004: API Design Philosophy (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard approach
- Excellent tooling ecosystem
- Self-documenting with FastAPI
- Easy integration for frontend clients

**Design Principles:**
- Resource-based URLs
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Comprehensive error responses
