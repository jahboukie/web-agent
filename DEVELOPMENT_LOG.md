## Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: Database Architecture (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** PostgreSQL as primary database with Redis for caching
**Rationale:** 
- Complex relational data requires ACID compliance
- Need for JSON fields for flexible metadata storage
- Redis provides high-performance caching for browser sessions
- PostgreSQL's async support aligns with FastAPI

**Alternatives Considered:**
- MongoDB: Rejected due to complex relationships between entities
- SQLite: Rejected due to scalability requirements

**Impact:** Enables complex queries and maintains data consistency

### AD-002: AI Model Integration Strategy (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** Multi-model approach with OpenAI and Anthropic
**Rationale:**
- GPT-4V for visual webpage analysis
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning and planning
- Fallback options provide reliability
- Different models excel at different tasks

**Implementation:**
- Abstract model interface for easy switching
- Configuration-driven model selection
- Cost and performance monitoring

### AD-003: Browser Automation Architecture (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** Playwright with Browserbase cloud integration
**Rationale:**
- Playwright's async support aligns with FastAPI
- Cloud browsers provide scalability
- Anti-detection capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Selenium: Rejected due to synchronous nature
- Pure cloud solution: Rejected due to cost and control concerns

### AD-004: API Design Philosophy (June 19, 2025)

**Decision:** RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard approach
- Excellent tooling ecosystem
- Self-documenting with FastAPI
- Easy integration for frontend clients

**Design Principles:**
- Resource-based URLs
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Comprehensive error responses

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Current Technical Debt

**TD-001: Placeholder Implementations**
- All API endpoints currently return 501 Not Implemented
- Need to implement actual business logic
- Priority: High (blocking development progress)
- Target Resolution: Phase 2

**TD-002: Missing Authentication/Authorization**
- JWT token validation not implemented
- User context not available in endpoints
- Security middleware incomplete
- Priority: High (security critical)
- Target Resolution: Phase 2

**TD-003: Database Connection Management**
- Async session factory needs testing
- Connection pooling configuration needed
- Migration strategy not defined
- Priority: Medium
- Target Resolution: Phase 1

### Future Considerations

**FC-001: Model Relationship Optimization**
- Some foreign key relationships may need optimization
- Consider denormalization for read-heavy operations
- Monitor query performance in production

**FC-002: Caching Strategy**
- Redis caching implementation needed
- Cache invalidation strategy required
- Consider CDN integration for static assets

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics (To Be Established)

- **Task Success Rate:** 85% by month 6
- **Average Response Time:** <30 seconds for common tasks
- **API Response Time:** <200ms for CRUD operations
- **Database Query Time:** <50ms for standard queries
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 100+ concurrent sessions

### Current Status

*Benchmarks will be established once core implementation is complete*
